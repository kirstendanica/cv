    <p>I'm a lover of all things related to science and the way the world and things residing inside of it work. I hate to call myself
      a jack of all trades and a master of none, so to keep this as clear and concise as possible, I'll name my favorite things. My main hobby
      and love is <strong>paleontology</strong>. Of course, following this, I love to study Earth science in general. I also have a love for
      <strong>fashion</strong> which umbrellas various subcategories, including but not limited to: web design (naturally), vintage and antique fashion,
      interior design, exploring new and interesting independent designers, so on and so forth. I love <strong>drawing and designing things in general</strong>
      which can be assumed if one visits my paleontology <a href="https://www.instagram.com/trilobitablonde/">Instagram profile</a>.
